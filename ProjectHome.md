# Massive Loading API #

The target of the Masapi is to provide a complete framework dedicated to the management of the massive loading into a flash/flex application. It is designed to be as easy as possible to use but also to be as flexible as possible.

There are the main features that the framework supports :
  * Same interface for all load managers (URLLoader, Loader, ...)
  * Easy massive loading classes
  * Advanced massive loading (priority, dependencies)
  * Advanced massive loading management (loading policy, loading information, ...)
