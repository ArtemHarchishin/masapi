= Introduction =

As you know probably, the real size of a file cannot be directly retrieved... You must wait the the first `ProgressEvent.PROGRESS` event is dispatched, so you can access the `bytesTotal` property of the load manager object. This article describes how the default implementation of a `IMassLoader` (also a `MassLoader`) does to manages the overall progress, even if the files are loaded one by one).

= The `bytesTotal` property =

Try this simple piece of code :
{{{
import ch.capi.net.*;

var factory:LoadableFileFactory = new LoadableFileFactory();
var file1:ILoadableFile = factory.create("file1.txt");
var file2:ILoadableFile = factory.create("file2.swf");

var massloader:IMassLoader = new MassLoader();
trace(massloader.bytesTotal); //4096000
}}}
