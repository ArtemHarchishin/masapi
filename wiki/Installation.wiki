This short page is a step by step guide to install masapi.

== Download ==

First step, you need to download the [http://code.google.com/p/masapi/downloads/list latest release] of Masapi. This package is a all-in-one package and contains the sources, the [http://www.astorm.ch/masapi/doc API reference] and the samples.

You can find other bundles [http://masapi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bundles/ here].

== Installation ==

The second step you need to have the 'ch' folder into the classpath of your project. There are two ways in flash to do that :
  * put the 'ch' folder in the same place as your FLA.
  * add the 'src' folder into your classpath (File > Publish settings > Flash > ActionScript 3 settings).

== Test ==

Just open your FLA (with the right classpath) and try this sample code :
{{{
import ch.capi.net.*;
import ch.capi.events.*;

var ml:MassLoader = new MassLoader();
ml.addEventListener(MassLoadEvent.FILE_OPEN, onFileOpen);

function onFileOpen(evt:MassLoadEvent):void { trace("open"); }
}}}

If it works correctly, then your installation is well done !
