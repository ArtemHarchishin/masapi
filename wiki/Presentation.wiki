= Masapi Project =

The target of the Masapi is to provide a complete framework dedicated to the management of the massive loading into a flash/flex application. It is designed to be as easy as possible to use but also to be as flexible as possible.

Here is a simple piece of code showing how it works :
{{{
import ch.capi.net.*;

//creates the file factory
var factory:LoadableFileFactory = new LoadableFileFactory();

//creates the files to load
var file1:ILoadableFile = factory.create("myFile.txt");
var file2:ILoadableFile = factory.create("myFile.swf");

//creates the load manager
var loader:MassLoader = new MassLoader();

//add the files to the loading queue
loader.addFile(file1);
loader.addFile(file2);

//starts the loading
loader.start();
}}}
